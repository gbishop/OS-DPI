# W3C Action Menu Button as a web component

This is my attempt to use the [W3C Action Menu Button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/menu-button/menu-button-actions.html) as
a web component for use in OS-DPI.

I am attempting to use their code unchanged or failing that with as few changes as possible. 

Their licence reads:

 *
 *   Desc:   Creates a menu button that opens a menu of actions
 */
 ```
